# Graph-Theory-using-Octave
I have designed a simulator kind of thing using octave which would take matrice(s) as input and also give  matrice(s) as its output The diagrams are drawn to show what convention I have followed.For some reason I can't execute these files.So my earnest request , go through them and tell me if anything seems wrong, execute it in your own shell and then show me.
Cheers!
